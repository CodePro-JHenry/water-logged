Water-Logged!

AS an individual trying to lose weight and/or stay fit
I WANT a water tracker application that provides an easy way to set targets and 
enter how many glasses of water I drink each day
SO THAT I can easily track my water intake and see if I am staying on track from any 
device that has Internet access.

REQUIRED FEATURES:
- Secure Registration/Login
- Ability for user to set/modify their own personal Daily Water goal with default suggested value of 8 cups/day
- Responsive interface that works equally well as a mobile application from mobile devices. 
- Intuitive, and VERY SIMPLE interface for user to add/remove glasses of water drunk
    - Ability to add water in 1/2 glass (4oz) or full glass increments
    - Ability to remove water in 1/2 glass (4oz) or full glass (8oz) increments
- Track each addition of water individually with timestamp (so that we can provide future
  features such as "stay hydrated" reminders)
    - Also, with each entry, record currently set "target" in case the user changes their
      target on a given day.  (This will also allow us to implement more advanced features
      in the future.)
- Summary report of water drunk so far for current day with 
  visual indication of how close the user is to their daily goal.
- Bar graph summary of last 7 days of water intake
- User water log data should be stored to server-side storage
- User data must NOT be accessible by other users!
